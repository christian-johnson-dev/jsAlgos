//? Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

//*You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
//*You can return the answer in any order.

//==== Inputs ====//
const array1 = [1, 5, 7, 10];
const num1 = 15;

const array2 = [4, 10, 0, 12, 15];
const num2 = 12;

const array3 = [16, 22, 78, -35];
const num3 = 43;
